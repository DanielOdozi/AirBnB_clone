# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
This project involves building a clone of the Airbnb website, with a phased development approach spanning the first year. The primary objective is to deploy a simplified version of the Airbnb platform on a server. The implementation will focus on key features to ensure coverage of fundamental concepts in the higher-level programming track.

## Project Phases

### 1. Command Interpreter
- Develop a command interpreter that allows manipulation of data without a visual interface, similar to a Shell.
- This component will be crucial for development and debugging purposes.

### 2. Website (Front-end)
- Create a website that serves as the front-end of the application.
- The website should showcase both static and dynamic content, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Airbnb clone.

### 3. Data Storage
- Implement a database or file system to store data, where data is represented as objects.
- This component is essential for persistently storing and retrieving information related to the Airbnb listings and user interactions.

### 4. API (Application Programming Interface)
- Develop an API that acts as a communication interface between the front-end and the data storage.
- The API should enable operations such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data, facilitating seamless interaction between the user interface and the underlying data.

## Timeline
- The project will unfold over the course of 4 months, with each phase contributing to the overall completion of the Airbnb clone.
- By the end of the first year, the goal is to have a complete web application comprising the command interpreter, a fully functional website, a robust data storage solution, and an API for efficient communication.

This project provides a comprehensive learning experience, covering various aspects of web development, database management, and API design.
